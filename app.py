1. Install Python, required Python packages, and get the gprMax source code from GitHub
2. Install a C compiler which supports OpenMP
3. Build and install gprMax

The recommended approach is using Miniconda:
- Download and install Miniconda (Python 3.x version)
- Open a Terminal/Command Prompt and run:
  ```
  conda update conda
  conda install git
  git clone https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax.git
  cd gprMax
  conda env create -f conda_env.yml
  ```
- Build and install with:
  ```
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

3. `#time_window`: Specifies the total simulation time (in seconds), e.g., `#time_window: 20e-9`

First, define a soil mixing model using the Peplinski formula:
```
#soil_peplinski: 0.5 0.5 2.0 2.66 0.001 0.25 my_soil
```
This creates a soil with sand fraction 0.5, clay fraction 0.5, bulk density 2g/cmÂ³, sand particle density of 2.66g/cmÂ³, and volumetric water fraction range of 0.001-0.25.

Then create the heterogeneous soil volume using:
```
#fractal_box: 0 0 0 0.15 0.15 0.070 1.5 1 1 1 50 my_soil my_soil_box
```
This defines a box with fractal distribution (fractal dimension 1.5) using 50 different materials from the my_soil mixing model.

You can also add surface roughness with:

The PML absorbs waves impinging on the boundaries of the computational domain, preventing unwanted reflections. gprMax uses a PML based on a recursive integration approach to the complex frequency shifted (RIPML) formulation.

By default, gprMax uses 10 cells of PML on all six sides of the model domain. You can control this using the `#pml_cells` command:

```
#pml_cells: 10 10 20 10 10 20
```

This sets the PML thickness for each boundary (x0, y0, z0, xmax, ymax, zmax). You can set any thickness to zero to turn off the PML on that boundary.

For advanced users, the `#pml_cfs` command allows customization of the PML parameters for better performance in specific applications.""",

3. For geometry visualization, gprMax produces VTK files that can be viewed using Paraview:
- `.vti` files are created from the `#geometry_view` command
- `.vti` files are also created from the `#snapshot` command for viewing the propagation of the electromagnetic fields at specific time steps

The model is implemented through the `#soil_peplinski` command with syntax:

```
#soil_peplinski: f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 str1
```

Where:
- f1 is the sand fraction (0-1)
- f2 is the clay fraction (0-1)
- f3 is the bulk density in g/cmÂ³
- f4 is the sand particle density in g/cmÂ³
- f5 and f6 define a range for volumetric water fraction
- str1 is an identifier for the soil

For example:
```
#soil_peplinski: 0.5 0.5 2.0 2.66 0.001 0.25 my_soil
```

The model relates relative permittivity of the soil to bulk density, sand particle density, sand fraction, clay fraction and water volumetric fraction. The real and imaginary parts of this semi-empirical model can be approximated using a multi-pole Debye function plus a conductive term.

This approach is typically used with the `#fractal_box` command to create soils with more realistic dielectric and geometric properties.""",

To use an antenna model in your simulation, you can access it via Python scripting in your input file:

```python
#python:

antenna_like_GSSI_1500(0.125, 0.094, 0.100, resolution=0.002)

```

The antenna models are inserted at location x,y,z specified in the function. The coordinates are relative to the geometric center of the antenna in the x-y plane and the bottom of the antenna skid in the z direction.

The models must be used with cubic spatial resolutions of either 0.5mm (GSSI 400MHz antenna only), 1mm (default), or 2mm by setting the optional resolution parameter.

You can also rotate the antenna models 90 degrees counter-clockwise in the x-y plane by setting the optional rotate90=True parameter.""",

#rx: 0.080 0.170 0
#src_steps: 0.002 0 0
#rx_steps: 0.002 0 0

2. Use the -n command line option to specify the number of model runs (A-scans):

python -m gprMax user_models/my_bscan.in -n 60

3. After the simulation, merge the individual A-scan output files:

python -m tools.outputfiles_merge user_models/my_bscan

python -m tools.plot_Bscan user_models/my_bscan_merged.out Ez
